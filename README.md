# [Windows 11 STIG PowerShell Hardening Scripts](https://github.com/KennethClendenin/stig-windows11-hardening/tree/main/scripts)

This repository contains PowerShell scripts developed to implement specific Windows 11 security controls, based on guidance from [STIGAVIEW](https://stigaview.com/), which references DISA STIGs (Security Technical Implementation Guides).

Each script focuses on a single control, uses a modular structure, and includes optional toggles for lab testing or demonstration purposes.

🎯 **Purpose:** Automate the application of STIG control implementations in Windows 11 environments using auditable, maintainable, and enterprise-ready PowerShell scripts.
